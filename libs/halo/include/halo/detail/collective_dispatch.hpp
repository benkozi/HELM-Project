///        for collective operations.
///
/// This detail utility centralizes the compile-time decision of HOW a collective
/// hands its send/receive memory to MPI. The decision is driven entirely by
/// `detail::requires_staging_v<ViewType>` (which already folds in the
/// `HALO_GPU_AWARE_MPI` compile-time flag — see memory_traits.hpp) via
/// `if constexpr`. There is NO per-element runtime branch on memory space.
///
///   requires_staging_v == false  (host view, OR device view + GPU-aware MPI)
///       -> pass `view.data()` directly to MPI (host-direct / device-direct).
///          (Requirements 6.1, 6.2)
///
///   requires_staging_v == true   (device view, no GPU-aware MPI)
///       -> `detail::pack` any required on-device strided source reorder into a
///          contiguous device buffer (Requirement 6.4), `detail::stage_send` it
///          to a host mirror, run the collective on host memory, then
///          `detail::stage_recv` the received data back to the device
///          destination in `finalize` (Requirement 6.3).
///
/// Consumer contract (used by gather_replicated, task 6.1):
///   1. Call `prepare(src, dest, send_count, recv_count)`. This returns a
///      `Dispatch_Buffers` value that owns any host-mirror(s) required to keep
///      the send/receive memory alive for the duration of the collective, and
///      exposes:
///        - `send_ptr()` : the pointer to hand to MPI as the send buffer
///                         (host mirror on the staged path, `src.data()`
///                         otherwise). `const T*`.
///        - `recv_ptr()` : the pointer to hand to MPI as the receive buffer
///                         (host mirror on the staged path, `dest.data()`
///                         otherwise). `T*`.
///   2. Run the MPI collective against `send_ptr()` / `recv_ptr()`.
///   3. Call `finalize(dispatch_buffers, dest, recv_count)`. On the host-staged
///      path this stages the host receive buffer back into the device `dest`
///      view; on the direct paths it is a no-op.
///
/// The returned `Dispatch_Buffers` MUST outlive the MPI collective (its owned
/// host mirrors back the pointers). Keep it in scope until after `finalize`.
